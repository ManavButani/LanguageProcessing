Which phase of compiler set the attributes of token in a symbol table?

 Identifiers and attributes are entered by the
analysis phases when processing a
declaration of an identifier.

 In simple languages with only global
variables and implicit declarations:
◦ The scanner can enter an identifier into a symbol
table if it is not already there.

 In block-structured languages with scopes
and explicit declarations:
◦ The parser and/or semantic analyzer enter
identifiers and corresponding attributes.
